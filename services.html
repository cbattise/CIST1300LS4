            <br>Each experience begins with a thorough consultation, followed by a tailored experience.
<br>Our salon is departmentalized, meaning we have color specialists and style specialists. When booking online, if you wish to receive both color and cut, please book accordingly.
    <br>Note: Hair consultations are always part of our colour services and are available complimentary prior to all first-time services.
    <br>Our color services do not include a blow dry. We have fully-stocked styling stations for you to use to blow dry your own hair. *this is not available currently due to Covid-19* If you would like a full professional blow dry following your color service, please request this at the time of booking. An additional charge will be added for this service.<br>
